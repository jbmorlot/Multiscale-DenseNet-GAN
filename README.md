##Introduction

## Multiscale-DenseNet-GAN (MSDN-GAN)
Multiscale DenseNet GAN in order to produce effective multiscale embeddings
The generator architecture use features discovered at each scales to fool the discriminator using concatenation as in DenseNet. 
Links are weighted and the network.



Loss= GAN loss+regularization
